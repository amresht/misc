Project:

1. Assumption is made that every dog collar when connects and saves its GPS location every 5 minute. 
This can be changed to fit the requirements by adjusting the pollign cycle.

2. The services can be implemented as monolitic services in the beginning. Later on each service can be broken down in smaller 
microservices which can have their own database/ servers/containers. 

3. The database can be chosen as relational in the beginning. Any open source DB such as MySQL or PostGreSQL can be used.

4. The implementation of the services can be done on Linux/Unix like platform. 

5. Choice of language to implementation can be Python/PHP for open source cost considerations.

6. A mesaging queue solution such as RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ is used for the interchange of messages.

7. The traffic exchanges data in JSON or XML format over HTTPS.  Encryption is needed for privacy concerns.

8. As the number of active users and traffic increases the number of hosts hosting services/middleware/database can be increased.
